dictionaries are a useful way to store different data that correlate to something. The usage can vary, as long as you have a key that can be used later on in the program.

the syntax for a dictionary is {}, with a : seperating a key and the value correlated to it. 
dictionary = {"name":"james"}
# 2 #
lists have a standard syntax. 
lst = ["james","jenni","merida"]

# 3 #
fstrings are also useful when you want to format strings that include variables.
For example, "james is " + age + "years old" can become
f"james is {age} years old"

isinstance is a cool function that checks if something is a specific data type.
For example, you'd pass a variable into the function, and then a data type and it will return the boolean value.
isinstance("james",str)   would return True.
